This challenge is to refactor code, so it comes out more organized for other developers to look at.

The following has been done to complete this task:
* added semantic tags on html page
* ensuring the html file elements have a logical structure and position (i.e. from h1 to h6, from header to footer)
* added alt atributes to the img elements
* consolidate the css code
* added comments to the html and css files

The website should look the same before and after the refactoring(improving it instead of changing the overall functionality)
